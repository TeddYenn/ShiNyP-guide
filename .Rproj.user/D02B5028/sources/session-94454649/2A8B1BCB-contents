# Post-GWAS {#sec-post-gwas}

1.  **Download Rice SNP data from SNP-Seek (3K RG):** We utilized the 3K
    RG 18 million Base SNP Dataset and the 3K RG 404k Core SNP Dataset.

2.  **Align Accession IDs:** Match the accession IDs between the
    phenotypic and SNP datasets.

3.  **SNP Data Processing and Quality Control:** Perform data generation
    and quality control on the SNP data for the subset of 311 samples.

4.  **Generate Final Genotypic Dataset:** Prepare the final genotypic
    dataset for GWAS analysis.

Data repository for the 3K RG, hosted by IRRI:

-   **3K RG 18mio Base SNP Dataset:** A base SNP set consisting of
    approximately 18 million SNPs was derived from the initial \~29
    million biallelic SNPs by excluding those with an excessive number
    of heterozygous calls.

-   **3K RG 404k CoreSNP Dataset:** The Core SNP set was derived from
    the filtered SNP set through a two-step LD pruning procedure.

Please download the PLINK `.bed`, `.bim`, and `.fam` files for the two
datasets. After downloading, extract the files and rename them as
`IRRI_18M_3024` and `IRRI_404K_3024`.

```{block, type = "rmdtip"}
The `%/%` operator does integer division (`x %/% y` is equivalent to `floor(x/y)`) so the index keeps track of which 80-line section of text we are counting up negative and positive sentiment in. 
```

```{block, type = "rmdnote"}
The reference genome for these datasets is 'Nipponbare MSU7/IRGSP1.0'.
```
